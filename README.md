Node.js Project: User Management System

Designed and developed a comprehensive user management system using Node.js and MongoDB, aimed at facilitating efficient administration and user interaction for a new website platform. 
The system included robust features to enhance user experience, security, and administrative capabilities:

User Authentication and Authorization: Implemented secure login and role-based access control (admin, editor, user) to manage permissions effectively.

Article Management: Developed functionalities for admins and editors to review and manage articles submitted by users. Articles have statuses such as draft,
under review, and published. Implemented CRUD operations for managing employee sections within posts.

User Profile Management: Enabled users to create and edit their profiles, including features for profile picture uploads and personal information updates.

Password Encryption and Security: Implemented strong encryption methods to safeguard user passwords, ensuring data security and confidentiality. 
Integrated a password reset feature with email verification.

Forgot Password: Integrated functionality for users to securely reset their passwords via email verification.

Email Notifications and Verification: Automated email notification systems for various actions such as account registration, 
password reset requests, and article status updates. Implemented contact messaging for technical support.

Newsletter Subscription: Implemented a feature for users to subscribe to newsletters, enhancing user engagement and communication.

Upload Pictures: Enabled users to upload and manage profile pictures or other images within their profiles.

Web Socket Notifications: Utilized WebSocket technology for real-time user notifications, improving user engagement and interaction within the platform.

Search and Filtering: Developed search functionalities to allow users to efficiently find articles based on keywords or categories.

Error Handling: Implemented robust error handling mechanisms to ensure smooth operation and user-friendly error messages.

Technical Support Messaging: Enabled users to send technical support messages directly through the platform.

CRUD Operations: Implemented CRUD operations for managing posts and employee sections, allowing admins to review, edit, or delete content as necessary.

Multi-stage Post Review Process: Posts can be submitted, reviewed, edited, and either rejected or passed to the next stage in the publishing process by admins and editors.

This project emphasized usability, security, and real-time communication, ensuring a seamless and secure user experience throughout the platform
